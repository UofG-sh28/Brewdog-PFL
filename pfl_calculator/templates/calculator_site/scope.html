            The Your Pledges tool then allows you to try lots of carbon cutting options and see how they impact your emissions.

            The Action Plan sets out a simple template for delivering the pledges, deciding who is responsible for delivering the Action, likely start and finish dates, a summary of what needs to get done, and importantly what is going to change and by how much. The action plan can help engage with staff and customers.
